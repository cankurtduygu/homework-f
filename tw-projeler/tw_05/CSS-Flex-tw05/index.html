                        <h2>HTML</h2>
                        <P>HTML is the foundational building block of web pages, defining their structure and content.
                            My
                            HTML courses cover everything from basic tags to complex structures, emphasizing the latest
                            features of HTML5. Students learn to create accessible, standard-compliant web pages that
                            are
                            also SEO-friendly. The training is designed for learners at all levels, aiming to thoroughly

                        <h2>CSS</h2>
                        <p>CSS is a crucial tool for styling and enhancing the aesthetics and user experience of web
                            pages.
                            In my courses, students explore everything from CSS selectors to advanced animations, layout
                            techniques, and responsive design principles. The focus is on modern layout systems like
                            Flexbox
                            and Grid, equipping students to create clean, effective, and maintainable style sheets.
                            These
                            courses blend both theoretical and practical aspects of CSS.</p>

                        <h2>React</h2>
                        <p>React, a popular JavaScript library for user interface development, is a key focus of my
                            training
                            program. Starting from the basics, the courses cover state management, life cycle methods,
                            and
                            creating reusable components. I emphasize modern features like React Hooks and the Context
                            API,
                            preparing students to develop interactive and contemporary web applications. The training is

                        <h2>Node.JS</h2>
                        <p>Node.js enables server-side JavaScript execution and is a powerful platform for web server
                            development. My training spans Node.js's fundamentals to RESTful API development and
                            database
                            integration. Students delve into advanced topics like asynchronous programming and

                        <p>SASS, a preprocessor language, enhances the dynamism and modularity of CSS. My courses cover
                            SASS
                            from its basics to advanced concepts, teaching cleaner, sustainable, and manageable style
                            sheet
                            creation. We focus on the efficiency of SASS in reducing code redundancy and enhancing
                            project
                            productivity. SASS is presented as a vital skill in modern web design, integral to creating
                            sophisticated styles.</p>
